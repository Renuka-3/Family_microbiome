**Completed tasks**

1.  Phyloseq: Create phyloseq object using metadata, OTU table and taxa
    table
2.  Beta diversity analysis: PCoA and PERMANOVA analysis was carried out
    with confounding factors such as age, gender, geographical location,
    diet and family.
3.  Hierarchial Clustering: Hierarchial Clustering carried out using
    Ward2 method.
4.  Alpha diversity analysis: alpha diversity estimated using Shannon

**ToDo**

1.  Random forest analysis for family predictions

    singleton sequences out of 1009)
2.  Analysis pipeline- Phyloseq or TSE/mia?
3.  If TSE then what about tree??
4.  Tracing family bacterial signatures?
