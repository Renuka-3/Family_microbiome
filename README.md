# Skin microbiota variation in Indian families
## The present study involves seventy-two individuals from fifteen families in two geographical regions of Maharashtra, India. This study underscores the diversity and commonalities in skin microbiota composition within and between families. ##

### Generate TSE object
Create TSE object using metadata, otu table, and taxa table. The data uses TreeSummarizedExperiment data container. 
```bash
Fam_TSE.Rmd
```

### Analysis scripts
Use the following scripts to perform the respective analysis
- [Figure 2 /Alpha diversity analysis](tse_alpha.Rmd): alpha diversity estimated using Shannon diversity index for all co-factors. 
- [Figure 3 /Beta diversity analysis](tse_beta.Rmd): PCoA and PERMANOVA analysis was carried out with confounding factors.
- [Figure 4 /dbRDA](RDA.Rmd)
- [Figure 5 /most prevalent microbiome](tse_core.Rmd): Location-wise relative abundances of the most prevalent phyla and genera in families.
- [Figure 6 /Inter-generational analysis](Intergeneration_analysis.Rmd): within and between family comparison across three generations.
- [supplementary figure 1](supplimentory.Rmd): Family-wise inter-generational analysis.
