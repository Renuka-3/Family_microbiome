# Family microbiome
# The present study investigates the differences in skin microbiota taxonomic diversity and composition within and between families. The study involves 72 healthy individuals from fifteen families, spanning three generations were analyzed # 

### Family data analysis

- [TSE](fam_tse.Rmd): Create TSE object using metadata, otu table and taxa table
- [Alpha diversity analysis](tse_alpha.md): alpha diversity estimated using Shannon diversity index for all co-factors.
- [Beta diversity analysis](tse_beta.md): PCoA and PERMANOVA analysis was carried out with confounding factors.
- [dbRDA](RDA.md)
- core
- [Inter-generational analysis](Intergeneration_analysis.md): within and between family member comparison across three generations.
- [Tables](tables.md): 
   1. Table1- Family data
   2. Table 2- PERMANOVA
   3. Table 3- Most prevalent genera (detection threshold=0.1%, prevalence>1%).
   4. Table 4-  Most prevalent Phyla (detection threshold=0.1%, prevalence>1%).
