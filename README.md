# Family microbiome
The project emphasize on analysis of skin microbiota in genetically related individuals.

### Family data analysis

- [TSE](fam_tse.Rmd): Create TSE object using metadata, otu table and taxa table
- [Alpha diversity analysis](tse_alpha.md): alpha diversity estimated using Shannon diversity index for all co-factors.
- [Beta diversity analysis](tse_beta.md): PCoA and PERMANOVA analysis was carried out with confounding factors.
- [dbRDA](RDA.md)
- core
- [x] [Inter-generational analysis](Intergeneration_analysis.md): Core microbiome analysis is perfomred on skin microbiota.
- [Tables](tables.md): Table1- Family data,
  Table 2- PERMANOVA
  Table 3- Most prevalent genera (detection threshold=0.1%, prevalence>1%).
  Table 4-  Most prevalent Phyla (detection threshold=0.1%, prevalence>1%).
