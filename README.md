# Skin microbiota variation in Indian families
## The present study involves seventy-two individuals from fifteen families in two geographical regions of Maharashtra, India. This study underscores the diversity and commonalities in skin microbiota composition within and between families. ##

### Generate TSE object
Create TSE object using metadata, otu table, and taxa table. The data uses TreeSummarizedExperiment data container. 
```bash
Fam_TSE.Rmd
```
### Analysis scripts
Use the following scripts to perform the respective analysis
- [Alpha diversity analysis](tse_alpha.Rmd) | [Figure 2](tse_alpha.md): alpha diversity estimated using Shannon diversity index for all co-factors. 
- [Beta diversity analysis](tse_beta.Rmd) | [Figure 3](tse_beta.md): PCoA and PERMANOVA analysis was carried out with confounding factors.
- [dbRDA](RDA.Rmd) | [Figure 4](RDA.md)
- [most prevalent microbiome](tse_core.Rmd) | [Figure 5](tse_core.md): Location-wise relative abundances of the most prevalent phyla and genera in families.
- [Inter-generational analysis](Intergeneration_analysis.Rmd) | [Figure 6](Intergeneration_analysis.md): within and between family comparison across three generations.
- [supplementary](supplementary.Rmd) | [supplementary figure 1](supplementary.md): Family-wise inter-generational analysis.
