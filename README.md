# Family microbiome
The project emphasize on analysis of skin microbiota in genetically related individuals.

### Todo

- [ ] PERMANOVA analysis by adjusting P values for multiple testing 
- [ ] Random forest analysis for family predictions

### Ongoing

- [ ] Alpha diversity analysis- jitterplots of groups using Shannon index 

### Completed âœ“

- [x] [Phyloseq](Phyloseq.Rmd): Create phyloseq object using metadata, otu table and taxa table
- [x] [Beta diversity analysis](Betadiversity.md): PCoA and PERMANOVA analysis was carried out with confounding factors such as age, gender, geographical location, diet and family.
- [x] [Hierarchial Clustering](HierarchialClustering.md): Hierarchial Clustering carried out using Ward2 method.
- [x] [Alpha diversity analysis](Alphadiversity.md): alpha diversity estimated using Shannon diversity index for all co-factors.
