# Family microbiome
## The present study involves seventy-two individuals from fifteen families in two geographical regions of Maharashtra, India. This study underscores the diversity and commonalities in skin microbiota composition within and between families. ##

### Family data analysis

- [TSE](fam_tse.Rmd): Create TSE object using metadata, otu table and taxa table
- [Figure 2/ Alpha diversity analysis](tse_alpha.md): alpha diversity estimated using Shannon diversity index for all co-factors.
- [Figure 3 /Beta diversity analysis](tse_beta.md): PCoA and PERMANOVA analysis was carried out with confounding factors.
- [Figure 4/ dbRDA](RDA.md)
- [Figure 5/ most prevalent microbiome)[tse_core.md): Location-wise relative abundances of the most prevalent phyla and genera in families.
- [Figure 6/ Inter-generational analysis](Intergeneration_analysis.md): within and between family member comparison across three generations.
- [Tables](tables.md): 
   1. Table1- Family data
   2. Table 2- PERMANOVA
   3. Table 3- Most prevalent genera (detection threshold=0.1%, prevalence>1%).
   4. Table 4-  Most prevalent Phyla (detection threshold=0.1%, prevalence>1%).
